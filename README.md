# Let's play: Waste at MIT

This is a game for a thesis project around the infrastrucutre legibility of waste systems. It takes the MIT Campus as it's focus, though the aim is to make a game that would be playable by, and entertaining/educational to anyone.

Right now, launch the game in your browser by downloading the repo, running `npm install`, and `npm start`.
